# BookList Application

The application will be a reading tracker that allows users to keep a list of books that they have read, including features such as rating, genre, and comments. These features can be updated anytime. Additionally, images can be uploaded as icons for the books. The application will also implement a __search and filter__ function based on a book's features.

## Interest
As an avid reader myself, I've always wanted a more personalized book tracker as I delve into lots of different genres of books and comics especially. Using this opportunity, I wanted to make an application that gave more freedom on the list of books I can add, and track them based off common fields.
